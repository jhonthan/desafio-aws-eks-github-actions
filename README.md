## üí° Idea
In this process, the idea is to create a new EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) using Terraform as IaC (Infrastruture as a Code) with the code stored in GitHub, and use the GitHub Actions to deploy the EKS, and the TFState stored in S3.

### üöÄ Process

1. Define the secrets in GitHub project:
 - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = Based in the credentilas of AWS (CSV).
 - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = Based in the credentilas of AWS (CSV).
 - `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` = This secret is the name of the bucket in S3.
 - `AWS_BUCKET_FILE` = This secret is the file on the bucket in S3, eg `my-state.tf`.
